  # In ruby numbers also have methods.
  # The times method allows you to run a given block of code 
  # a certain number of times:
  
  10.times do
    line @x, @y, @x, @y + len
    @x += spacing
  end
  
  # There's also an alternative method called step,
  # You call it on the number you'd like to start with,
  # passing it the end number, and the size of the steps to take:
  # start_num.step(stop_num, step_size) { |value| do_something_with value ...
  
  50.step(150, spacing) { |x| line x, @y, x, @y + len }
  
  # The curly braces are an alternative form for writing do ... end.
  # So, I guess this isn't much of a demonstration of the for loop...
