[Learning Processing][] by Daniel Shiffman is an  book that serves as a gentle introduction to 
the theory and practice of programming. It works by introducing code concepts 
over the course of 23 chapters, and creating a series of examples that build 
on them. Daniel Shiffman is a professor of the Interactive Telecommunications Program at New York University.
