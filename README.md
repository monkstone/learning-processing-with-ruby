## Learning Processing examples adapted to ruby-processing ##

[Learning Processing][] by Daniel Shiffman is an  book that serves as a gentle introduction to 
the theory and practice of programming. It works by introducing code concepts 
over the course of 23 chapters, and creating a series of examples that build 
on them. Daniel Shiffman is a professor of the Interactive Telecommunications Program at New York University.



These samples have been ported over to [Ruby-Processing][] here.


Daniel Shiffman, has written another book [The Nature of Code][] which has also been ported to ruby-processing [here][].
